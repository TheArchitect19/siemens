Automated Test Environment for Library Compatibility and Error Reporting

Objective
To establish a test environment for our Python project to:
1. Ensure all project dependencies are compatible.
2. Detect version mismatches and library conflicts.
3. Automate error reporting before running the main project.

Steps to Implement the Test Environment

1. Setup a Virtual Environment
   - Purpose: Isolate dependencies to avoid conflicts with system-wide libraries.
   - Command:
     ```bash
     python -m venv test_env
     source test_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: test_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - This ensures a clean and controlled environment.

2. Dependency Installation
   - Install project dependencies from a requirements.txt file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Use pip to handle library installation and version management.

3. Create a Dependency Validation Script
   - Write a script (test_env.py) to:
     1. Verify all required libraries are installed.
     2. Check for version mismatches or missing packages.
     3. Report issues in a human-readable format.
   - Example of the script:
     ```python
     import pkg_resources
     import sys

     def check_libraries(requirements_file):
         print("Validating project dependencies...\n")
         try:
             with open(requirements_file, 'r') as f:
                 dependencies = f.readlines()
             for dependency in dependencies:
                 dependency = dependency.strip()
                 try:
                     pkg_resources.require(dependency)
                     print(f"{dependency} - OK")
                 except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:
                     print(f"{dependency} - NOT FOUND")
                 except pkg_resources.VersionConflict as e:
                     print(f"{dependency} - VERSION CONFLICT: {e}")
         except Exception as e:
             print(f"Error checking libraries: {e}")
             sys.exit(1)

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         requirements_file = "requirements.txt"  # Update the path if needed
         check_libraries(requirements_file)
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     Validating project dependencies...

     numpy==1.21.0 - OK
     pandas==1.3.0 - OK
     matplotlib==3.4.0 - VERSION CONFLICT: (matplotlib 3.3.0 is installed, but matplotlib==3.4.0 is required)
     ```

4. Automate Functional Testing
   - Run automated tests using frameworks like pytest after validating dependencies:
     ```bash
     pytest --tb=short
     ```

5. Error Reporting
   - Log all dependency errors into a report file for debugging:
     ```python
     with open("dependency_report.log", "w") as log:
         log.write(f"{dependency} - {status}\n")
     ```
